Cython
- write more like c, with range loops over i, type def, simple control flow etc, no list comprehension

# Blog Questions:
- why does just giving the type in cython give such a significant speedup
    - b/c python does not need to infer the type anymore, so converting to pure C is easier

#Open Questions:
- better general interop between python lists and c arrays
